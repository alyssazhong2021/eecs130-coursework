    <h1>1. Jones Bar-BQ</h1>
    <p> Jones Bar-BQ is the definition of heartwarming. Mary and Deborah Jones, aka
        "Shorty" and "Little" grew up working alongside their late father's BBQ restuarant.
        Now, as women, they are two of the few female pit masters that exist in their city.
        Although the family restauarnt closed after their dad died, they've reopend it to help
        pay for Little's daughter's college tuition. The restuarant, Jones Bar-BQ is a small,
        run-down shack. Despite their restuarant's popularity, the two sisters take no help and
        work tirelessly to make orders inside their restaurant's incredily tight, un-air conditioned space.
        By the end of the episode, Bobby transforms the shack into a gorgeous, destination restuarant.
        Antoni is able to help the sisters package their famous BBQ sauce to be sold in stores. Karamo convinces
        the sisters to actually take time to care for themselves. And Jonathan and Tan make the Little and Shorty see
        that they still "got it." Particularly, Jonathan helps Shorty fill in a missing tooth that resulted from a childhood accident.
        Her smile after seeing her new smile literally made me cry. What made this episode the ultimate Queer Eye episode was
        the geniune gratitude coming from the sisters. They welcomed the Fab 5 into their lives as if they were family and were eager to
        accept whatever help they could provide. Even when the sisters  didn't react in the most positive manner, like when they
        had to disclose their BBQ sauce recipe in order for it to get packaged, it simply showed how much they cared about their family business.
        These women are good women. The best that they come, and they deserved every bit of pampering they received.
