    <h1>7. To Gay or Not too Gay</h1>
    <p> AJ Brown is our hero of this episode - the first and only gay hero of Queer Eye! He was nominated by his
      best friend Al for "needing work in a lot of different areas." Particularly, he acts like different people
      at work, with his friends and boyfriend, and with his family. Not to mention, he is not openly gay and is
      very self-conscious of "looking gay." His biggest life regret is not coming out to his dad before he died.
      With things getting serious with his boyfriend, he wants help coming out to his stepmom. Throughout the episode,
      AJ grapples with not wanted to appear too "feminine" or being afraid people will be able to tell his sexual preference
      just by looking at him. The Fab 5 eventually teach him that being your true self isn't going to offend anybody. when
      he does come out to his stepmom at the end, its one of the most emotional scenes in Queer Eye history. He reads her a letter
      he meant to read to his late father, crying and apologizing for hiding this part of him for so long. His stepmom is loving and supportive
      in return, and for that it was the happiest of endings.
