    <h1>2. Hunter to Huntee </h1>
    <p> I remember waiting for what felt like 12310129830 years for season 3 to release, and I was so psyched
        to see that first episode of the season featured a female hero! Jodie is the definition of a badass. She
        works as a guard at an all-male prison, and hunts and farms for nearly all her food. She's a true country
        girl who loves camo a little too much (even camo lingerie), but she's uncomfortable going out with her husband beyond hunting
        and fishing. In fact, she was nominated by her husband Chris because while he thinks she beautiful, he also
        sees that she doesn't feel confident in herself. Growing up in a poor farming family, Jodie doesn't feel uncomfortable
        with her femininity, as she has had always had to act tough and fears that femininity just means frilly. Karamo
        eventually introduces her to a diverse set of women, and Jodie learns that femininity is simply whatever makes her
        feel confident. It certainly resonated with me, and it her husband's adorable reaction to her makeover was the cherry on top!
