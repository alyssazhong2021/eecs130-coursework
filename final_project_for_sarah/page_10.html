    <h1>10. Make Ted Great Again</h1>
    <p> This week's hero is Ted Terry, the youngest mayor in Clarkston, Georgia history! Ted was nominated by his girlfriend
        Andrea who rightfully claims he's a hipster mayor. Ted has a long, hippie-like, self-proclaimed "resistance beard," that makes
        people not take him seriously. Additionally, Ted gave his office to other city hall workers who were more in need of a
        common space, causing to work on the go, leave piles of documents throughout his home, and never establish a routine. At
        end of the week, he is hosting a dinner at his house for delegates from the Phillipines and Sierra Leone, and he would like
        the Fab Five's help to present his best self and a welcoming home. This is the first and only political figure featured on
        Queer Eye and very well exemplifies the show's values of diversity and acceptance. Clarkston is known for its population of
        various ethnicities, and Ted is champion for underrepresented groups throughout the episode. His tranformation is truly phenomenal,
        as you can tell he now feels confident about how he presents himself and confident as the face of Clarkston.
