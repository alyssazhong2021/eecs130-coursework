    <h1>3. You Can't Fix Ugly</h1>
    <p> This was the first episode of the first season of the Queer Eye revamp, and it did not dissapoint.
        Tom Jackson is a vintage car-lover and garbage truck driver. He lives alone in a basement apartment, and has
        married and divorced multiple times. He still sees one of his ex-wives Abby regularly. His signature line
        throughout the transformation is, "You can't fix ugly," to which the Fab 5 of course combat by promoting self-love.
        The episode concludes with Tom showing Abby around his newly renovated apartment, sharing some chips and guac, and
        asking her to a dinner date. She says yes, and spoiler alert, they're remarried now! Tom is literally the epitome of sweet
        old man (although he's not that old, just has old man vibes). When Tom recounted his week to Abby, it was so sweet to see him
        attribute little things to members of the Fab 5, like "Antoni taught me how to make this" or "Tan said this color would be flattering."
        It was like a little kid showing off what he had learned, and you felt the same sense kiddish-sense of wonder that Tom did.
