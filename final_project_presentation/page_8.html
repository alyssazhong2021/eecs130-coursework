    <h1>8. A Decent Proposal</h1>
    <p> William Menken is the hero of this episode! He was nominated by his live-in girlfriend of three years Shannan, who
      claims he has no style, no grooming routine, and has gotten complacent in their relationship. She has expressed the
      desire to get married many times, but William has no idea how to approach it, fearing heartbreak and rejection. Also
      all the furniture in their house is from Shannan's previous marriage. Yikes. The Fab 5's mission is to help William
      find the courage he needs for the ultimate marriage proposal. Shannan and William are honestly like the cutest couple
      ever. He hangs a note she wrote him over his mirror so he sees it every morning, they have a book about their love story,
      and they both claim each other to be "the one." Once the Fab 5 spiff William up and get him to believe that he can
      in fact be the man of her dreams, he proposes in an amazing way. The Fab 5 help this film buff create a video leading
      up to his proposal and play it at an ampitheater during one of their dates. He gets down on one knee and she says yes - first
      and only Queer Eye proposal!
