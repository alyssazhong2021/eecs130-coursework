    <h1>6. Camp Rules </h1>
    <p> Bobby Camp is doin the most. He has six kids in small house with 1 bathroom, works as a drafter in an engineering firm from 9 to 5,
        waits for the kids to go to bed, and then goes to a home improvement store to stock shelves, leaving him with a solid 3 hours of sleep
        a night. He was nominated by his wife of 12 years Vera for never taking time for himself. Understandably, she says he looks like a "homeless
        person" sometimes with greasy hair and stained clothes, but he is incredibly generous and patient with family. Vera and Bobby also express
        disappointment in their wedding, as it was not at their church of choice (the family is deeply religious) and their photographer abandoned them
        with no photos. The Fab 5's mission is to help Bobby take care of himself in his chaotic life and also organize a wedding reception redo. What was interesting
        about this episode was the religious element. Bobby acknowledges that homosexuals are not accepted in a lot of religious spaces and affirms that he wanted
        the Fab 5 to feel welcome with open arms in the Camp household. The fact that there's six kids running around also makes the episode super fun. The physical transformations
        are some of the best to date. Fab 5's Bobby turns their wildly disorganized and cluttered house into a funtional space, and our hero Bobby tranforms from a "homeless person"
        into an incredibly handsome father.
