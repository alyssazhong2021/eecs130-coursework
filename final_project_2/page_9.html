    <h1>9. Dega Don't</h1>
    <p> Cory Waldrop is the controversial hero of this episode. He is a police officer and Nascar fanatic who throws
      wild parties featuring crazy costumes in his basement for the Talladega Dega Do Club. These parties go on despite
      the fact that he lives with his wife of 14 years with two daugthers. He'd like to be able to spice up his wardrobe
      beyond t-shirts, gym shorts, and flip flops, especially when he goes out with his wife, aka the woman who puts up
      with the parties, cooks, and cleans. This episode was controversial due to the fact that Cory is a Trump supporter.
      Not to mention, the episode opens with a police officer stopping the Fab 5 and telling Karamo to get out of the car.
      The group prepares themselves for another instance of discimination and police abusing their power, only to find out
      the officer is Henry, Cory's best friend and nominator. Later in the episode, Karamo and Cory have a talk about police
      brutality, Karamo expressing that he doesn't want all black people to be seen as criminals while Cory expressing that he
      doesn't want all police to be seen as villains. The two eventually come to an understanding, and Karamo expresses how much
      he respects Cory as a father and as an officer and feels that he has made a true friend. It was a great way to bring up hot
      topics in the United States today and gave you hope that perhaps we can all eventually see eye to eye.
