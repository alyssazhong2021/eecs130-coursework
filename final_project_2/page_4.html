    <h1>4. Saving Sasquatch</h1>
    <p>
      The hero of this episode, Neal Reddy is super relatable. He lives alone with his dog and is pretty uncomfortable around
      people. He separates all aspects of his life - from work to friends to family - in an effort to maintain comfort and protection.
      One of the funniest moments of the episode is when the Fab 5 initially spot him walking his dog, and they all ran out to hug him and play with
      his incredibly long, sasquatch-like hair. In response, Neil cringes away and says, "This is so cool that you guys are just touching me willy nilly,"
      followed by uncomfortable laughter. Aside from his social awkwardness though, Neal is a very funny, successful guy about to launch his own app. what
      makes this episode so memorable is Neal's mini speech to the Fab 5 at the conclusion of the week. As Jonathan so perfectly put it, Neal can't try to
      shut people out and "numb vulnerability" without numbing joy, happiness, and connection. Neal then stands up and says, "This has been a completely weird
      and beautiful experience. I just want to thank you guys. I was in a big down spell, like a really dark place. In the past couple months, I've been super
      comfortable being in that dark place. And for some reason I didn't fight my way out of it. And that's why this meant a lot to me... All those weird laughs you heard -
      that's the first time in a long time I've just been like joyful. When I started out the week I felt like this was just highlighting what was wrong in my life. And
      by the end of the week I realized it wasn't highlighting what was wrong in my life. It was showing me how good my life could be if I just cared. I can't thank you guys
      enough... I mean from the bottom of my heart, that's the nicest thing anyone has done for me." For someone who couldn't even initially make eye contact with the members of the
      Fab 5, this was a huge, heartwarming transformation.
