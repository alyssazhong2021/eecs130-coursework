    <h1>5. Hose before Bros</h1>
    <p> This week's hero Jeremy Holmes is a jokester and the Chief of Training at the Covington Fire Department. He's definintely
      a guy all about giving back. He founded the annual East Metro Firefighter's Conference for fire fighters to get
      cheap training, and he and his wife have 5 adopted kids who are all biological siblings. In fact, he didn't even
      want Bobby to makeover his house. Instead, he wanted Bobby to redo the firehouse. This episode is also packed with
      a bunch of laughs. The Fab 5 are in a firehouse, after all, so expect to see some of the members (Jonathan) oogling
      over the firemen. You'll definitely want to catch the Fab 5 and the firefighters taking a Waltz class. At the end of
      the week, Jeremy hosted a fundraiser for the East Metro Firefighter's Conference and reached their $10,000 goal.
      Ultimately, it seemed that not only Jeremy has been impacted by the Fab 5, but the entire fire department as well. You could tell
      the rest of the firefighters were so thrilled to see Jeremy, a guy who's constantly given to others, finally be treated to
      something special himself.
